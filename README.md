# SpellTell

SpellTell is an educational app that helps adults improve their spelling. SpellTell is a quick and easy way to practice spelling whenever a user can find a spare minute. Exercises can be done  on mobile or desktop devices. If you are waiting for a bus, a zoom host to start a meeting, or commuting, you can open and go over a couple dozen words. This is an amazing way to always upgrade your spelling skills.

Learning with SpellTell can also be very intensive. You can use it for hours, and for multiple days in a row. People who use it intensively are usually motivated by an imminent  promotion, or they may be moving to a new country, starting a new college course, or simply wanting to bulletproof their spelling. SpellTell is an educational app that is still in development.
