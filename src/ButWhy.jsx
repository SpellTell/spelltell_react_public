            <br />
</p>
<p>But why we have made it free?</p>
          <h3 style={{textAlign:"left", fontSize:"24px", fontWeight:"400"}}>- Because your better life should not wait for us to find time to finish this app! </h3>

          <p>I moved to an English-speaking country a few years ago. My career was going at a steady pace and I liked my job. There was only one thing that was giving me headaches: Spelling.
          </p>
          <p>I never had time to sit and practice.</p>
          <p>I had to choose whether to sit and practice my spelling or sit and read about management. Having been recently promoted to a managerial position, my choice was obvious. I had to be good at understanding people rather than words and sentences. </p>
          <p>This is why I put my English education on a back burner. </p>
        <p> Sometimes, I would make a funny mistake that would make my whole team laugh.</p>

        <p>For example. When I was hiring new web devs, I usually started with <strong>breadth‚Äçüí®</strong> interviews. But, you know, if I felt hungry I would sometimes start <strong>breadüçû</strong> interviews. My boss was always a bit worried that I would eat the candidates instead of hiring them.</p>

          <p>This is why I made <img className="img-fluid logo" src={logo} alt="" />'s first version completely free. Practice now, and thank us later.
          </p>
          <p>Will the full version be paid? <br />
          Yes. To keep improving this app, we will make a full version commercial. Servers are expensive, and we also want to be able to hire some experts eventually. Although, I don't expect this amazing app will cost you more than a good frappuccino. </p>

          <p>For everyone who would like to contribute to our endeavors, you can <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/spelltell">fix us a frappuccino</a>  right now üòä.</p>
